/**
 * The actual payment instruction. After the server decrypts MeshPacket.ciphertext,
 * it gets one of these.
 *
 * Critical fields for security:
 *   - nonce: a UUID unique to this payment. Even if everything else were identical
 *            for two legitimate payments (alice sends bob ₹100 twice), the nonces
 *            differ, so the resulting ciphertexts and their hashes also differ.
 *   - signedAt: lets the server reject stale packets ("freshness window"). Without
 *               this, an attacker who got the ciphertext could replay it weeks later.
 *   - pinHash: in a real system the user enters a UPI PIN; we'd verify it against
 *              a hash held by the bank. Here we just record it for realism.
